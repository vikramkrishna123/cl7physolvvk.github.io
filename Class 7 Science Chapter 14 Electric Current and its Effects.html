            <font size="4">6) When the current is switched on through a wire,
             a compass needle kept nearby gets deflected from its north-south position. Explain.
             <br>
             solution:<br>
             When current is passed through the wire, it deflects the compass near it from its north-south position like a magnet.
              This is called magnetic effect of the current. As we know that needle of the compass is made up of a thin magnet.
               When this needle comes in contact with another magnet then the like poles of the magnet repel each other and 
               opposite poles attract each other. So the deflection is seen in the needle. 
             In this case the wire behaves like a magnet and causes deflection in needle of the compass.</font>

                Solution:<br>
                No, the plastic bags do not get attracted by the magnet, so they cannot be separated by an electromagnet.
                Plastic bags are not magnetic materials, only magnetic materials like iron can be attracted by the magnet.</font>

                 He wants to replace a fuse by a piece of wire. Would you agree? Give reasons for your response.<br>
                 Solution:<br>
                 It is not a wise idea to replace fuse by a piece of wire, as it has very low melting point. In case of metal piece, 
                 melting point will be high and the circuit will be intact in case there is overload or overheat.</font>

                <font size="4">12)Zubeda made an electric circuit using a cell holder shown in Fig. 14.4, a switch and a bulb. 
                When she put the switch in the ‘ON’ position,the bulb did not glow. Help Zubeda in identifying
                 the possible defects in the circuit.<br>
                 <img src="ansfig12.png"><br>
                 Solution:<br>
                 It is important to put the cells in right series. The positive terminal of the first cell should be connected with 
                 negative terminal of the second cell.The switch should be closed properly and bulb should not be fused. If Zubeda will check these then the bulb will
                   certainly glow.</font>
